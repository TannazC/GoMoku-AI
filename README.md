Gomoku AI is an AI-driven board game player that competes against human opponents on an 8x8 board. The AI evaluates possible moves using a heuristic-based decision algorithm and detects winning strategies using pattern recognition.

Features:

    AI opponent that implements rule-based evaluation for optimal move selection.
    Winning pattern detection for open, semi-open, and closed sequences.
    Turn-based gameplay with alternating moves between player and AI.
    Console-based UI displaying real-time game status.

Skills & Concepts Used:

    Python and algorithmic thinking
    Game AI and heuristic evaluation
    Pattern recognition and move ranking
    State management and turn-based logic
